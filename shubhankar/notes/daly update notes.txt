https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-date-format

https://www.w3schools.blog/date-object-typescript 

todays task is to build traffic voilation records and get all output date wise

 
c.l(date.tolocalstring());
[  a : b : c].join(':')
[  a-b-c].join('-')

month starts from 0 index , so add +1
join date and time through concatination
padd is used to give no of digits 'starting digit'

fs-file system module allows you to work with the file system on your computer
The fs.readFileSync() method is an inbuilt application programming interface of fs module which is used to read the file and return its content. 
syntax:---- fs.readFileSync( path, options )

 path.join() method is used to join a number of path-segments using the platform-specific delimiter to form a single path.
 The final path is normalized after the joining takes place.

var splited =str.split('' ,4) = ['a','p','p','l'] 
var splitted1 =str.split('' ,4) = [ 'appleis', 'good', 'for','the']
var splitted2 = str.split(' ',4) = [ 'appleis', 'good', 'for','the']

tostring()- return a string representing a string

search ->     str1.search(str2)  == -1  then found else not
